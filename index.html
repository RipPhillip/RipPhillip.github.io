	<p>I'm currently working with <a href="https://samth.github.io/">Sam Tobin-Hochstadt</a> on my senior thesis,
	  creating a partial evaluator for <a href="https://github.com/pycket/pycket">Pycket</a>, a high-performance tracing JIT compiler for Racket.
	  I also work as an <a href="#teaching">undergraduate instructor</a> for our programming languages course,
	  and run an undergraduate programming languages <a href="#readinggroup">reading group</a>.
	  I'm a <a href="#coxscholar">Cox Exploratory Scholar</a>, a scholarship given to motivated students who must maintain high academic performance
	  along with a part-time job. I currently assist and mentor University Division students as a Peer Coach,
	  guiding them through the process of starting a successful college career. <br /></p>

	<p>I'm particularly interested in compilers, language design, type systems, and of course, functional programming.</p>
	<p>Previously, I worked with <a href="https://www.cs.indiana.edu/~rrnewton/homepage.html">Ryan Newton</a> on adding higher order functions and polymorphism to <a href="https://github.com/iu-parfunc/gibbon">Gibbon</a>, a highly-optimized compiler that generates code which operates directly on serialized data.
	  <br /> <br />
	  I participated in the <a href="http://www.isri.cmu.edu/education/reu-se/index.html">Software Engineering REU</a> program at Carnegie Mellon University this past summer. I worked on <a href="https://mcoblenz.github.io/Obsidian/">Obsidian</a>, a domain-specific language for blockchain programs, which is designed in a user-centered way and incorporates typestate and linear types to catch certain common errors at compile time. I worked on a case study evaluation, and submitted a <a href="files/obsidian-case-study.pdf">two-page abstract</a> which received second place at the 2018 SPLASH Student Research Competition. One thing to note is that my work resulted in adding assets to the state level, which couldn't be included in this submission, but is included on the poster.</p>

      <div id="readinggroup" class="box"><h1 id="" class="boxtitle">undergraduate reading group</h1>
	<p>Programming languages papers are notoriously hard to read.
	  But that doesn't stop us from trying! Often it can be even more overwhelming when around PhD students and professors
	  who have been studying these topics for years. I started this group because I wanted to create an environment where undergraduates
	  interested in programming languages could learn and ask questions without pressure or fear of judgment.
	  We meet weekly (over pizza of course) and have a fun time figuring out these tough papers together.
	  If you're at IU, <a href="mailto:pkoronke@iu.edu">email me</a> to join our email list.</p>
	<b>Fridays, 5:30-6:30pm Luddy Hall 1104</b><br /> <br />

	<p> The <a href="https://coxscholars.indiana.edu/index.html">Cox Scholarship</a>
	  is given in honor of the hardworking Jessie and Beulah Cox.
	  It requires me to maintain a competitive GPA and a part-time job.
	  Currently, I work as an <a href="https://ud.indiana.edu/resources-opportunities/resources/peer-coaches.html">IU Peer Coach</a>.
	  Previously, I assisted in teaching the EDUC-X 152: Mapping Your Future course.</p>
